## **Introduction of Airbnb**

*    The San Francisco-based startup Airbnb was founded in 2007 when two hosts opened their residence to three visitors. Since then, the firm has expanded to over 4 million hosts and hosted over 1.5 billion guests in practically every nation.

*    Airbnb serves as an online accommodation marketplace that links customers searching for short-term lodging with those wishing to lease out their properties. Airbnb gives hosts a comparatively simple method to make a little money from their homes.

*    The basic premise of Airbnb is to connect locals with those who have extra space in their homes or apartments that they can rent out to tourists. With the security of knowing that a large firm will manage payments and provide other assistance, hosts utilizing the platform get to market their rentals to millions of individuals around the world.
