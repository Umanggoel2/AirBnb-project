        "* The San Francisco-based startup Airbnb was founded in 2007 when two hosts opened their residence to three visitors. Since then, the firm has expanded to over 4 million hosts and hosted over 1.5 billion guests in practically every nation.\n",
        "* Airbnb serves as an online accommodation marketplace that links customers searching for short-term lodging with those wishing to lease out their properties. Airbnb gives hosts a comparatively simple method to make a little money from their homes.\n",
        "* The basic premise of Airbnb is to connect locals with those who have extra space in their homes or apartments that they can rent out to tourists. With the security of knowing that a large firm will manage payments and provide other assistance, hosts utilizing the platform get to market their rentals to millions of individuals around the world.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Purpose of EDA:***\n",
        "* The main goal of this analysis is to understand the pattern and to provide useful insights into AirBnb to improve its functionality and serviceability.\n",
        "* Firstly data is to be explored and cleaned using different data wrangling techniques. The missing or null values are to be handled carefully as they will create problems during data analysis and can affect statistics and computations. Duplicates and outliers are also dealt with in this cleaning process only as they can cause errors in data collection, data entry, or data merging and can lead to false analysis results.\n",
        "* After cleaning of the data, the identification of different patterns and trends present inside the data can be done using various data visualization techniques. Various graphs and charts can be created to visualize the data, and record observations and insight which will be very useful for future analysis and decision-making related to Airbnb."
